The Intensive Care Units in Ecuador have a high mortality rate 
because of many difficulties, like the lack of a patients 
permanent tracking system. This project will develop an app to help this issue.
The project has 3 sub-systems, an app developed for Android devices that gets the 
data from the hospital’s server. The app has a window login and a vital sign’s 
monitor for each patient and also holds an emergency notification service.

It will provide accurate data for the patient's status with a latency not greater than 3s. 
The app shows static values for the current state of the person
and also provides graphics to analyze the persons overall status, during the
last hours or by showing the average measurement during the las 3 days (group by day).

During runtime the app uses an average of 2.11 Kb/s of traffic 
data and a maximum of 250Mb of RAM. This system is a feature that will help to 
track the ICU patient’s status, allowing doctors and ICU managers to work outside 
the unit.

The other sub-systems are a MySQL database that will store the patient’s data and a 
PHP server to build and hold the connection between the other two sub-systems.
